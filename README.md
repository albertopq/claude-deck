## Installation

### Via npm (Recommended)

If you already have Node.js 24+ installed:

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g @atercates/claude-deck

# Run setup (checks/installs tmux, ripgrep, builds app)
claude-deck install

# Start the server
claude-deck start
```

### Via curl (Installs everything)

For fresh installs without Node.js:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ATERCATES/claude-deck/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
claude-deck start
```

### Desktop App

Download native desktop apps from [Releases](https://github.com/ATERCATES/claude-deck/releases):

- macOS (Apple Silicon): `.dmg`
- Linux: `.deb` or `.AppImage`

> **Note:** The desktop app is a native wrapper around the web UI. You still need to install and run ClaudeDeck (via the installer script above) for the backend server. The desktop app just provides a convenient native window instead of using your browser.

> **Don't want to self-host?** Try [ClaudeDeck Cloud](https://runagentos.com) - pre-configured cloud VMs for AI coding.

### Manual Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ATERCATES/claude-deck
cd claude-deck
npm install
npm run dev  # http://localhost:3011
```

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 24+
- tmux
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) (for code search - auto-installed by installer script, or run `claude-deck update`)
- At least one AI CLI: [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code), [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex), [OpenCode](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode), [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli), [Aider](https://aider.chat/), or [Cursor CLI](https://cursor.com/cli)

## Features

- **Mobile-first** - Full functionality from your phone, not a dumbed-down responsive view
- **Voice-to-text** - Dictate prompts to your coding sessions hands-free
- **Multi-pane layout** - Run up to 4 sessions side-by-side
- **Code search** - Fast codebase search with syntax-highlighted results (Cmd+K)
- **File picker** - Browse and attach files to sessions, with direct upload from mobile
- **Clone from GitHub** - Clone repos directly from the UI when creating projects
- **Git integration** - Status, diffs, commits, PRs from the UI
- **Git worktrees** - Isolated branches with auto-setup
- **Dev servers** - Start/stop Node.js and Docker servers
- **Session orchestration** - Conductor/worker model via MCP

## CLI Commands

```bash
claude-deck run       # Start and open browser
claude-deck start     # Start in background
claude-deck stop      # Stop server
claude-deck status    # Show URLs
claude-deck logs      # Tail logs
claude-deck update    # Update to latest
```

## Mobile Access

- **[aTerm](https://github.com/ATERCATES/aTerm)** - A Tauri-based desktop terminal workspace for AI-assisted coding. While ClaudeDeck is a mobile-first web UI, aTerm is a native desktop app with multi-pane layouts optimized for running AI coding agents (Claude Code, Aider, OpenCode) alongside shells, dev servers, and a built-in git panel. Choose ClaudeDeck for mobile access and browser-based workflows, or aTerm for a native desktop terminal experience.
